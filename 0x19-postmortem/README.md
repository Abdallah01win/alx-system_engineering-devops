# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: May 6, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC)
  - End Time: May 7, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** 
  - The outage affected the core authentication service, rendering it completely inaccessible.
  - Users experienced login failures and were unable to access any authenticated features on the platform.
  - Approximately 35% of users were affected.

## Timeline:
- **10:15 PM:** The issue was detected via monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication errors.
- **10:20 PM:** Engineers began investigating the issue, focusing initially on the authentication service and database connectivity.
- **11:00 PM:** Initial assumption pointed towards a database overload due to increased traffic.
- **11:30 PM:** Further investigation revealed no significant increase in database load, leading to reconsideration of the root cause.
- **12:00 AM:** Escalation to senior engineers and the operations team for additional support.
- **1:30 AM:** Intensive log analysis uncovered an unexpected configuration change in the authentication service module.
- **2:00 AM:** The issue was resolved by rolling back the recent configuration change.
- **3:00 AM:** Normal service functionality was restored, and monitoring confirmed stability.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** 
  - The root cause of the outage was identified as an undocumented configuration update in the authentication service module. This change led to misconfigurations, causing authentication failures.
- **Resolution:** 
  - The issue was fixed by reverting the configuration changes to the last known stable version. Additionally, thorough documentation of configuration procedures was initiated to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement stricter change management policies for configuration updates to prevent unauthorized changes.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time visibility into configuration changes and their impacts.
  - Conduct regular audits of critical service configurations to ensure alignment with documented standards.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conduct a postmortem meeting to review the incident, identify lessons learned, and assign action items.
  - Update documentation to include detailed procedures for configuration changes and rollbacks.
  - Schedule training sessions for the engineering team to emphasize the importance of adhering to established change management processes.
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular insights into service disruptions, including specific error types and affected components.

## Conclusion:
The outage incident underscored the critical importance of robust change management processes and proactive monitoring in maintaining service reliability. By implementing the corrective measures outlined above, we aim to mitigate similar incidents in the future and ensure uninterrupted access to our platform for all users.
